            <h3>About Divide and Conquer</h3>
            <p>Divide and Conquer is an algorithm design paradigm that works by recursively breaking a problem down into smaller subproblems until they become simple enough to be solved directly. 
                The solutions to the subproblems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.
                Divide and Conquer algorithms are often more efficient than other types of algorithms for solving the same problem because they reduce the overall amount of work that needs to be done at each step.
                Some well known examples of Divide and Conquer algorithms include Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Binary Search.

            <p> Divide and Conquer can be used to solve the following problems:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Searching and sorting large amounts of data efficiently</li>
                <li>Finding the closest pair of points on a plane</li>
                <li>Multiplying two polynomials</li>
                <li>Finding the n-th largest peice of data in a list</li>
