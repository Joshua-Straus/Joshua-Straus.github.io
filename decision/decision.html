            <h3>Deciding Which Algorithm Design Paradigm to Use</h3>
            <p>Deciding which deisgn paradigm best applies usually consists of analyzing what potential subproblems exist within the larger problem.
                Good algorithms tend to break complicated problems down into easily solbeable subproblems. 
                If the subproblems are independent of each other, Divide and Conquer is often a good choice. 
                If the subproblems overlap, Dynamic Programming is often a good choice.
                If the problem can be solved by making a series of locally optimal choices, Greed is often the most efficient choice.
