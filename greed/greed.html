            <h3>About Greed</h3>
            <p>Greedy algorithms are a type of algorithm that make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment, with the hope of finding a global optimum. 
                Greedy algorithms do not always produce the optimal solution for every problem, but they can be very efficient and work well for certain types of problems.
                Many problems that greedy algorithms are used to solve can be solved optimally using other design paradigms, but greedy algoritgms are often simpler and more efficient.
            </p>
            <p> Algorithms developed with the greedy paradigm can be used to solve hugely imporant problems such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Efficiently compressing data</li>
                <li>Finding the most efficient way to schedule tasks</li>
                <li>Finding the shortest route from one location to another</li>
            </ul>
