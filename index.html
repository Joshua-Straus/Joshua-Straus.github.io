            <h2>About Algorithms</h2>
            <p>An Algorithm is a series of <strong>step instructions designed to solve a specific problem</strong>. 
                Algorithm design is a major topic in the fields of Mathematics and Computer Science. 
                Many different problems in Computer Science have a number of key similarities that allow them to be solved with similar algorithms.
                Computer Scientists have developed a number of strategies that can be used to design algorithms for a variety of problems. 
                The major algorithmic design strategies that this website will cover are:
            </p>
            <dl> 
                <dt>Divide and Conquer</dt>
                <dd>Solves by breaking up into discrete subproblems, solving and recombining</dd>
                <dt>Dynamic Programming</dt>
                <dd>Solves by solving trivial problems first and iteratively building up to final solution</dd>
                <dt>Greed</dt>
                <dd>Solves by always finding best answer up to a certain point up until the final solution is found</dd>
                <dt>Deciding Which Paradigm to Use</dt>
                <dd>Knowing which paradigm to use is just as important as knowing the paradigms themselves</dd>
            </dl>
            <p> Algorithms developed with the paradigms listed above can be used to solve hugely imporant problems such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Searching and sorting large amounts of data efficiently</li>
                <li>Finding the most efficient way to schedule tasks</li>
                <li>Finding the shortest route from one location to another</li>
                <li>Keeping your information secure on the internet</li>
                <li>Compressing data</li>
                <li>Keeping the internet running smoothly through efficient network routing</li>
            </ul>
